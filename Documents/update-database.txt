Since entity framework tools requires an "interface" type project with microsoft.entityframeworkcore.design and microsoft.entityframeworkcore.tools in order to make migrations and database updates. Each module needs to have a console app in order to run EF commands against.

In order to ensure that the sql server container is running, run the console app 

To reset migrations to a single, initial, migration delete the database from ssms and delete all migrations plus DataContextModelSnapshot.
Then rerun add-migration / update-database
